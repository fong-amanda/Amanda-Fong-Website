                <h>To make Spotify a more social app that evokes nostalgia, I implemented a feature that takes the music
                    the user has listened
                    to and creates playlists based on time period. It then allows the user to pick photos, which creates
                    a collage for the cover of the playlist in CD form. The user can then share this throwback playlist,
                    evoking a feeling of nostalgia in themselves and others the playlist is shared to.
                </h>

        <h3>Interview Takeaways</h3>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>People mainly use the app to make playlists of their favorite songs
            </li>
            <li>Many like making shared playlists
            </li>
            <li>Some people use Blends for fun with their friends but doesn’t end up listening to the Blended playlists
                that Spotify makes because often half the songs on them are “suggested” ones and not the ones that they
                and the other person in the Blend actually listen to
            </li>
            <li>People only look at the friends listening feature on the desktop
            </li>
            <li>People often like to discover new artists, but usually listen to artists they already knows and like
            </li>
            <li>People sometimes check concert venues and dates on Spotify
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Refine Statements</h4>

            <li>As a secretary at a Fintech company, Kira has a very busy schedule and wants an easy way to connect with
                her friends through music since she doesn’t have much free time throughout the day.
            </li>
            <li>As someone who loves music and misses her friends and family back home, Kira wants music as a way to
                bring nostalgia to her life.
            </li>
            <li>As someone who loves to go on walks and is constantly listening to music, Kira wants an easier way to
                discover new music that maybe her friends are listening to.
            </li>
        </ol>
